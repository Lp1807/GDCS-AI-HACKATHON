However, the passage of half a century has affected our collective knowledge of the war. While World War II remains of interest to military scholars, historians, and veterans, a generation of Americans has grown up with limited awareness of its political, social, and military significance. This war united the American people with a common purpose like no other conflict before.' metadata=ParagraphMetadata(pdf_name='WW2_short.pdf', page='1')
