Given the following context: '{context}' generate a question and four answer options. 
3 of them have to be false, while 1 should be true.
The output must be given in a particular JSON format. 
For instance, if the question is "What is the capital of France?" and the multiple choices
are:
A: "Rome",
B: "Paris",
C: "Brussels",
D: "Sidney"

with "Paris" being the correct one, the output must be like this:
{
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Rome",
      "B": "Paris",
      "C": "Brussels",
      "D": "Sidney"
    },
  "correctOption": "B",
  "contextIDs": ["123", "434", "224", "143"]
}

where the contextIDs field is {ids}
