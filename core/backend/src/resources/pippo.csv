content='Proteins play key roles in cellular function and disease. This paper introduces a multi-scale graph construction called HOLOPROT for proteins, connecting surface, structure, and sequence at different levels. The graph encoder learns a multi-scale representation by integrating encodings from lower levels. The representation is tested on ligand binding affinity (regression) and protein function prediction (classification) tasks. The model outperforms baselines on regression tasks and achieves competitive performance on classification tasks with fewer parameters.' metadata=ParagraphMetadata(pdf_name='Multi-Scale Representation Learning on Proteins.pdf', page='1')

content='Protein design and engineering are vital for pharmaceutical research and development. Understanding the structure and function of proteins is crucial for developing new technologies and therapeutics. Representations that capture the complex nature of proteins are needed for predicting protein properties and studying disease mechanisms. Proteins consist of amino acids forming linear sequences with unique side chains, leading to vast combinatorial possibilities. The folding process driven by the primary sequence results in a three-dimensional structure with rich physiochemical properties. Previous methods often focus on individual aspects (sequence, structure, or surface) rather than considering multiple scales simultaneously.' metadata=ParagraphMetadata(pdf_name='Multi-Scale Representation Learning on Proteins.pdf', page='1')
content='Ablation studies evaluate the contribution of HOLOPROT to learning multi-scale protein representations. The performance of the multi-scale model is found to be superior to using isolated structure or surface representations. Results show that different protein scales are more relevant for specific tasks. For instance, predicting enzyme-catalyzed reactions based on surface alone leads to poor performance.' metadata=ParagraphMetadata(pdf_name='Multi-Scale Representation Learning on Proteins.pdf', page='1')
